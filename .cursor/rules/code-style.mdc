# Code style

- **Minimal**: Prefer the smallest change that works. No extra abstractions, layers, or "future-proof" code until needed.
- **Clean**: Clear names, few moving parts. Remove dead code and unused styles/imports.
- **No over-engineering**: No premature patterns, factories, or generic utilities. Solve the current problem.
- **Fast**: Avoid unnecessary work (extra renders, API calls, large bundles). Reuse what exists.
- **Scalable**: Structure that’s easy to extend later (clear files, simple data flow). Don’t add complexity for hypothetical scale.

When in doubt, ship the simpler version.
